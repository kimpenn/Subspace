# A subspace clustering method for satisfying stoimetric constraints in scRNA-seq # 

This clustering approach was developed to identify and categorize cell populations within single-cell RNA-seq data. It leverages this subspace structure and learns a cell-to-cell affinity matrix based on notions of subspace similarity. It also faciliates recovery of information on developmental time.
